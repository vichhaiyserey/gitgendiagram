# AGENTS.md — AI Agent Operating Manual & Safety Guardrails

This document establishes the mandatory operational boundaries, architectural constraints, and verification protocols for autonomous AI coding assistants (such as Antigravity, Claude, Copilot, Cursor, and Windsurf) working within the `secdiagram` repository.

All AI agents operating on this codebase **MUST** read, understand, and adhere to these guidelines.

---

## 🎯 1. Core Mission & Philosophy

`secdiagram` is a lightweight, high-performance, deterministic static analysis engine that generates:
- **Human-friendly system architecture diagrams** (`secdiagram.com` and C4 style) in Mermaid, PNG, SVG, and PDF.
- **Detailed architectural relationship graphs** (modules, classes, methods, endpoints, database schemas, queues).
- **SAST security overlays & threat models** citing exact `path:line` references, exportable to OASIS SARIF v2.1.0.
- **Evidence-grounded AI architectural narratives** via local Ollama or OpenAI endpoints without hallucinations.

The guiding motto is: ***Small but Gold*** — minimal footprint, zero runtime bloat, maximum reliability.

---

## ⛔ 2. Absolute Non-Negotiable Constraints

Agents must **NEVER** violate these 8 cardinal rules:

### Rule 1: Zero External Runtime Dependencies
- **Constraint**: `secdiagram`'s core package **must remain 100% standard library**.
- **Action**: Never add any third-party package to `dependencies = []` in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Allowed Exception**: Tooling required purely for developer workflows (such as `ruff`, `mypy`, `bandit`, `pip-audit`, `coverage`) belongs exclusively in `[project.optional-dependencies] dev`.
- **Runtime implementation**: Use standard library modules (`ast`, `urllib`, `dataclasses`, `hashlib`, `json`, `pathlib`, `re`, `shutil`, `tempfile`, `subprocess`).
- **Supply-chain pinning**: All non-runtime tooling must be exact-pinned (`==`) in `pyproject.toml`; CI must pin pip/build tool versions; GitHub Actions must use full commit SHAs with version comments; container and Compose images must use exact tags plus `@sha256:` digests; npm dependencies must be installed from the committed `docker/mermaid/package-lock.json` via `npm ci`. Never use `latest`, version ranges, or floating action tags.

### Rule 2: Strict Determinism
- **Constraint**: The exact same codebase analyzed multiple times must produce byte-for-byte identical output (`diagram.mmd`, `diagram-highlevel.mmd`, `graph.json`, `security.sarif`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`).
- **Action**:
  - Never iterate over unordered `set` or dictionary keys when writing diagram elements, markdown, or JSON.
  - Always use `stable_id(*parts)` from `secdiagram_core.model` to generate IDs.
  - Sort lists and keys deterministically before output serialization.

### Rule 3: Zero Code Execution on Analyzed Repositories
- **Constraint**: `secdiagram` is designed to analyze potentially untrusted third-party repositories.
- **Action**:
  - **NEVER** use `eval()`, `exec()`, `compile()`, or `importlib.import_module()` to inspect code.
  - All source analysis must be performed strictly via AST parsing (`ast.parse`) and static regex/manifest parsing.
  - Treat all inspected code as untrusted data.

### Rule 4: 100% Offline-First Architecture
- **Constraint**: The CLI and analysis pipeline must execute seamlessly on air-gapped systems without internet access.
- **Action**:
  - Never make hardcoded, mandatory network requests during core analysis.
  - Image rendering fallbacks (Kroki, mermaid.ink) and LLM narratives must be strictly optional opt-in features with graceful local error handling.
  - Respect the `--offline` flag everywhere.

### Rule 5: Zero Secret Leaks & Rigorous Pre-Commit Hygiene
- **Constraint**: Never introduce or commit real API keys, credentials, tokens, passwords, private keys, or `.env` files into source code, test fixtures, documentation, or commit messages.
- **Action**:
  - In unit tests and fixtures, use obvious mock placeholders (e.g. `mock_token_12345`, `dummy-api-key`).
  - Never edit or bypass `.gitignore` or `.dockerignore` to force-track ignored or sensitive files.
  - Run a secret pattern scan before committing.

### Rule 6: Promote Through `develop` — `main` Is Release-Only
- **Constraint**: `main` is the stable, release-ready branch. Autonomous AI agents must **NEVER** push direct commits to `main` (or `master`) and must **NEVER** merge a feature branch directly into `main`. All verified feature work must land on `develop` via a feature-branch merge.
- **Action**:
  - Treat `develop` as the integration branch and keep it current with `main`.
  - Create feature branches from `develop`, commit the work, and push them to `origin`.
  - Create or select the tracking issue first, move it to `In Progress` with `python scripts/taskctl.py start <issue>`, and move it to `In Review` when the pull request opens.
  - After the full verification suite passes, **do not leave completed work uncommitted**: merge the verified feature branch into `develop` locally and push `develop`. This default commit-and-merge step is pre-authorized for verified work; it does not require a separate user request.
  - After the merge is verified, close the task with `python scripts/taskctl.py done <issue> --evidence-file <file>` and refresh the cache with `python scripts/taskctl.py sync`.
  - Push `develop` only as the result of a clean local feature-branch merge or the automated `develop-sync.yml` main sync.
  - Open additional Pull Requests against `develop` when human review is required.
  - Merge `develop` into `main` only when a release is ready; release tags belong on `main`.
  - After a release, sync `main` back into `develop` (the `develop-sync.yml` workflow automates this and fails loudly on conflicts).

### Rule 7: Mandatory Container Image Vulnerability Gating & Reachability Analysis
- **Constraint**: Autonomous AI agents must **NEVER** build, release, or push container images to Docker Hub (`vserey/secdiagram`) or any distribution registry with unresolved **CRITICAL** or **HIGH** severity image vulnerabilities.
- **Action**:
  - Prior to initiating, approving, or committing release workflows or container pushes to `vserey/secdiagram`, agents must ensure that all Critical and High severity vulnerabilities discovered in container scanning (e.g. via Trivy) are fully resolved.
  - **Hard Blocking Default**: If any Critical or High vulnerability is detected, pushing the image is **strictly blocked** by default. Agents must never bypass this gate blindly with `exit-code: 0`, `--ignore-unfixed`, or unverified suppressions.
  - **Permitted Exception (Contextual Reachability & Exploitability Analysis)**:
    If an upstream fix is unavailable from base image distributors (e.g., Debian or Node upstream CVEs) and cannot be resolved through dependency updates or image hardening, the push may ONLY proceed if the agent performs and documents a formal **Contextual Reachability and Exploitability Analysis** demonstrating with certainty that the vulnerability is **not actually reachable and not exploitable** in `secdiagram`'s container environment:
    1. **Execution Path & Call Flow**: Prove the vulnerable function, binary, or package is never loaded, imported, or executed by `secdiagram` CLI, the platform server, or Mermaid CLI.
    2. **Attack Surface & Ingress**: Confirm that the container does not expose listening services, open network daemons, or untrusted external inputs to the affected library.
    3. **Privilege & Sandboxing**: Verify that running as unprivileged user `secdiagram` (`uid 10001`) with read-only/volume mounts prevents exploitation or privilege escalation.
    4. **Audit Trail Documentation**: Record the formal analysis citing specific CVE ID, affected package/version, CVSS score, reachability rationale, non-exploitability proof, and upstream tracking issue in a documented security audit or baseline before allowing the push to proceed.

### Rule 8: Mandatory Task Tracking (Init -> Progress -> Done)
- **Constraint**: Every non-trivial change must be tracked on GitHub Issues and the Projects v2 board. GitHub is the source of truth; the local cache under `.secdiagram/tasks/` is a read-only, gitignored snapshot.
- **Action**:
  - Before editing code, create or select a task with `python scripts/taskctl.py new ...` (or link an existing issue).
  - Move the task through the lifecycle with `start`, `block --reason`, `unblock`, `review`, and `done --evidence-file`.
  - Record the verification evidence (tests, lint, types, SAST, container, Trivy) in the issue before closing it.
  - Link the pull request with `Closes #N`; the `tasks-pr-check.yml` workflow fails without a linked issue.
  - Run `python scripts/taskctl.py sync` after status changes. Never edit or commit `.secdiagram/tasks/`.
  - If `gh` is unavailable or unauthenticated, stop and ask the user rather than creating an untracked workflow.

## 🧪 4. Required Agent Verification Steps

Before declaring any coding task complete or committing changes, AI agents **MUST** execute the following verification steps in sequence:

### Step 0: Confirm Task Tracking
```bash
python scripts/taskctl.py start <issue>
```
- **Requirement**: The change has an open GitHub issue with `type:*` and `priority:*` labels and the task is `In Progress` before code is edited.

### Step 1: Run Full Unit Test Suite
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
- **Requirement**: The full test suite (currently 210+ tests) must pass with exit code `0`.
- If new functionality was added, corresponding unit tests must be added in `tests/test_*.py`.

### Step 2: Verify Code Quality & Type Safety
```bash
# Lint checks
ruff check .

# Static type analysis
mypy
```
- **Requirement**: Zero lint errors and zero type errors.

### Step 3: Run Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
```bash
python -m bandit -r secdiagram_core -lll
```
- **Requirement**: Zero high/critical severity findings.

### Step 4: Run Containerized Build & Smoke Test Verification
```bash
# Build local candidate image
docker build -t secdiagram:verify .

# Smoke test CLI help and offline diagram generation
docker run --rm secdiagram:verify --help
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/repo" secdiagram:verify --dir /repo/tests/fixtures/sample_app --out /tmp/verify-out --format mermaid --image png --no-security
```
- **Requirement**: Container image builds cleanly without errors; CLI executes correctly as non-root user `secdiagram` (`uid 10001`); headless Chromium and Mermaid CLI render diagrams offline.

### Step 5: Run Container Image Vulnerability Scan with Trivy
```bash
trivy image --severity CRITICAL,HIGH secdiagram:verify
```
- **Requirement**: Zero unresolved Critical or High vulnerabilities. In accordance with Rule 7, any unfixable upstream base image CVE must have a documented Contextual Reachability Analysis confirming that the finding is neither reachable nor exploitable in `secdiagram` before publication or release. Otherwise, the image is blocked from publication.

### Step 6: Verify Git Working Tree
```bash
git status
git diff
```
- **Requirement**: Ensure no unintended files (such as `.coverage`, cache directories, test image dumps, or `.env` files) were modified or staged.

## 🔒 5. Security & Secure Coding Rules for Agents

1. **Non-Cryptographic Hashing**:
   Whenever calling `hashlib.sha1` or `hashlib.md5` for deterministic identifier generation (e.g. in `stable_id`), you must pass `usedforsecurity=False` to prevent Bandit `B324` / FIPS alerts:
   ```python
   digest = hashlib.sha1(data.encode("utf-8"), usedforsecurity=False).hexdigest()
   ```

2. **Safe Path Normalization & Traversal Prevention**:
   - Always resolve paths safely against the repo root:
     ```python
     target = (root / rel_path).resolve()
     if not str(target).startswith(str(root.resolve())):
         # Path escapes root directory - skip safely!
     ```
   - Never allow absolute paths from untrusted user configurations to escape root.

3. **Subprocess Execution**:
   - Never use `shell=True` in `subprocess.run` or `subprocess.Popen`.
   - Pass arguments strictly as a `list[str]`.
   - Always specify a reasonable `timeout` (e.g. `timeout=30`).

4. **Network Requests**:
   - All HTTP requests via `urllib.request.urlopen` must set an explicit `timeout`.
   - Catch specific exceptions (`urllib.error.HTTPError`, `urllib.error.URLError`, `TimeoutError`).
   - Do not leak authorization tokens or credentials in exception error messages.

5. **Python Typing Conventions (PEP 585 & PEP 604)**:
   - Target Python 3.10+.
   - Use `|` for unions: `str | None` instead of `Optional[str]`.
   - Use built-in generic collections: `list[T]`, `dict[K, V]`, `set[T]`.
   - Import abstract collection types from `collections.abc` (`Iterable`, `Mapping`, `Sequence`), **never** from `typing`.

6. **Container Image Security & Vulnerability Gating**:
   - Always build containers using minimal, hardened base layers (`python:*-slim`, `node:*-slim`) with exact `@sha256:` digest pins.
   - Enforce non-root execution (`USER secdiagram`, UID 10001) and drop unnecessary capabilities.
   - Never suppress or ignore Critical or High image CVEs without a comprehensive, documented contextual reachability evaluation.
   - **Contextual Reachability & Exploitability Analysis Protocol**:
     - *Reachability*: Determine whether the vulnerable symbol or library is dynamically loaded or statically linked in any path reachable by user inputs or execution commands.
     - *Triggerability*: Assess whether inputs supplied to `secdiagram` (e.g., analyzed source repositories, CLI arguments) can flow into the vulnerable component.
     - *Network Exposure*: Confirm that no unauthenticated network services expose the vulnerable component to untrusted traffic.
     - *Documentation*: Record all findings, justifications, and verification steps in project security documentation, audit notes, or inline scanner configurations prior to container publication.

## 📝 6. Branching, Commit & Pull Request Conventions for Agents

When creating branches, committing changes, or pushing on behalf of the user, AI agents must:

1. **Branch Roles & Promotion (Feature → `develop` → `main`)**:
   - `main` is the stable, release-ready branch. It receives only release merges from `develop` via Pull Request.
   - `develop` is the integration branch. It must always contain the latest `main` and all verified feature merges.
   - Feature branches are short-lived and branch from `develop` (use `main` only for an urgent hotfix).
   - **NEVER** commit directly to `main`, and **NEVER** merge a feature branch directly into `main`.
   - Feature work may enter `develop` only through a verified feature-branch merge (never by editing `develop` in place).
   - Check the active branch with `git branch --show-current` before committing.
   - Standard branch naming prefixes:
     - `feat/<feature-name>` for new capabilities or analyzers.
     - `fix/<bug-or-alert-name>` for bug fixes or security remediations.
     - `ci/<workflow-name>` for CI/CD workflow updates.
     - `docs/<doc-update>` for documentation updates.
     - `refactor/<module-name>` for refactoring without functional changes.

2. **Feature Development, Verification, and Local Merge into `develop`**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout develop
   git merge --ff-only origin/develop
   git checkout -b <prefix>/<descriptive-name>
   # implement, test, and commit
   git push -u origin <prefix>/<descriptive-name>
   ```
   - Before merging, update the feature branch from the latest `develop` and run the full verification suite.
   - **Mandatory final step**: once all verification gates pass and the branch is clean, commit any remaining intended files, merge the feature branch into `develop`, and push `develop`. Do not stop with verified work left uncommitted or unmerged unless the user explicitly asks to pause.
   - Merge locally with a merge commit, resolve any conflicts on the feature branch, and never commit conflict markers:
     ```bash
     git fetch origin
     git checkout develop
     git merge --ff-only origin/develop
     git merge --no-ff <prefix>/<descriptive-name>
     python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
     python -m ruff check .
     mypy
     python -m bandit -r secdiagram_core -lll
     python scripts/taskctl.py validate --offline
     docker build -t secdiagram:verify .
     docker run --rm secdiagram:verify --help
     trivy image --severity CRITICAL,HIGH secdiagram:verify
     git push origin develop
     ```
   - Open a Pull Request targeting `develop` when human review is required.
   - Never force-push `main`, `develop`, or any shared branch.

3. **Release Promotion (`develop` → `main`)**:
   - Merge `develop` into `main` only when the release is ready and all CI gates pass.
   - Verify that container image scanning meets the Rule 7 threshold (all Critical and High CVEs resolved or proven unreachable/unexploitable via contextual analysis) before tagging releases that trigger Docker Hub pushes to `vserey/secdiagram`.
   - Use a Pull Request from `develop` to `main`; do not push directly to `main`.
   - Tag releases on `main` only after the release merge is verified. Tagging is a human release action; agents must not create or push tags unless explicitly instructed.
   - Immediately sync `main` back into `develop` after a release so `develop` remains the latest integration branch.

4. **Follow Conventional Commits**:
   - `feat:` for new capabilities or analyzers.
   - `fix:` for bug fixes.
   - `ci:` for CI/CD workflow updates.
   - `docs:` for documentation updates.
   - `test:` for test additions or refactoring.
   - `refactor:` for code restructuring without behavioral change.
5. **Provide a Meaningful Multi-Line Description**:
   Summarize the specific technical changes, impacted modules, and test results.
6. **Never include AI internal metadata or conversational artifacts** inside commit messages.
