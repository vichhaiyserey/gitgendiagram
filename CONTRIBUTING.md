## 🏛️ Architectural Principles

Before writing code, please keep the four core tenets of `secdiagram` in mind:

1. **Zero External Runtime Dependencies**: The core CLI, AST analyzer, graph builder, and renderers must run on the **Python standard library only**. We do not add third-party runtime wheels to `dependencies = []` in `pyproject.toml`. This eliminates supply chain risk and ensures instant installation.
2. **Deterministic Output**: Analyzing the same repository state must always yield identical outputs (`diagram.mmd`, `graph.json`, `security.sarif`, etc.). IDs are computed via deterministic hashing (`stable_id`). Never iterate over unordered sets or dict keys when writing outputs.
3. **100% Offline-First**: All core analysis, diagram generation, and security checks must run without internet access. Any remote feature (e.g. Kroki, mermaid.ink, OpenAI API) must be strictly optional with graceful local fallbacks.
4. **Security by Design**: `secdiagram` inspects untrusted repositories. It must never execute (`eval`, `exec`, `importlib`) analyzed code. All file reading, path resolutions, and YAML/JSON parses must be hardened against path traversal and deserialization attacks.

## 📜 Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all contributors. Please treat others with respect, empathy, and professional courtesy in all project interactions, including issues, pull requests, and discussions.

## 🚀 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version **3.10** or higher (tested on 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14).
- **Git**: Installed and configured.
- *(Optional)* **Docker**: For testing containerized execution and local Ollama reviews.
- *(Optional)* **Node.js & Mermaid CLI (`@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`)**: For testing local offline PNG/SVG/PDF image rendering.

### Step-by-Step Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vserey/secdiagram.git
   cd clone-secdiagram
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   # Linux / macOS
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate

   # Windows (PowerShell)
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

3. **Install the package in editable mode with development dependencies**:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install "pip==26.3"
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

   Development dependencies installed via `.[dev]` include:
   - `ruff`: High-speed linter and import formatter.
   - `mypy`: Static type checker.
   - `coverage`: Test coverage suite.
   - `bandit`: Static application security testing (SAST) for Python.
   - `pip-audit`: Known CVE dependency auditor.

---

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Running Unit Tests

Run the full test suite using Python's built-in `unittest` runner:

```bash
# Run all unit tests
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v

# Run a specific test module
python -m unittest tests/test_security.py -v

# Run with test coverage
python -m coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests
python -m coverage report
```

> **Note**: Test suite must achieve **≥ 80% coverage** across `secdiagram_core`. All existing 134+ tests must pass without regressions.

### Linting and Formatting

We use `ruff` for linting and import sorting:

```bash
# Check code style and imports
ruff check .

# Automatically apply safe fixes
ruff check . --fix
```

### Type Checking

We use `mypy` with Python 3.10+ strict typing rules:

```bash
mypy
```

### Security and SAST Scans

Run automated security gates before pushing commits:

```bash
# Run Bandit SAST gate (high severity)
python -m bandit -r secdiagram_core -lll

# Generate full Bandit JSON report
python -m bandit -r secdiagram_core -f json -o bandit.json

# Check installed dev dependencies for vulnerabilities
python -m pip_audit --strict --skip-editable
```

---

## 🗂️ Task Tracking

Every non-trivial change is tracked on **GitHub Issues** and a **Projects v2 board**. GitHub is the source of truth; the local cache under `.secdiagram/tasks/` is a gitignored, read-only snapshot for offline work.

Lifecycle: `Backlog -> Ready -> In Progress -> In Review -> Done`, with `Blocked` while waiting on a dependency or decision.

```bash
# Create a task and add it to the board
python scripts/taskctl.py new --type feature --title "Add Go manifest detection" \
  --priority P1 --area discovery --milestone 0.3.0

# Move through the lifecycle
python scripts/taskctl.py start <issue>
python scripts/taskctl.py block <issue> --reason "waiting on upstream API"
python scripts/taskctl.py review <issue>
python scripts/taskctl.py done <issue> --evidence-file evidence.md

# Refresh and validate the offline cache
python scripts/taskctl.py sync
python scripts/taskctl.py validate --offline
```

Pull requests must reference an issue with `Closes #N`; the `tasks-pr-check.yml` workflow fails otherwise. See [docs/TASK_TRACKING.md](docs/TASK_TRACKING.md) for one-time setup, board fields, and troubleshooting.

## 📐 Coding Guidelines

### 1. Zero Runtime Dependencies
- **Strict Rule**: Do not add packages to `dependencies = []` in `pyproject.toml`.
- Use Python's standard library modules (`ast`, `urllib`, `dataclasses`, `hashlib`, `json`, `pathlib`, `re`, `shutil`, `tempfile`, `subprocess`).
- If a feature requires external tooling (like rendering images via Mermaid or executing local LLMs), interact with the CLI binary or standard HTTP protocols with robust error handling and offline fallbacks.

### 2. Strict Determinism
- Stable IDs must be created using `stable_id(*parts)`.
- Never iterate over unordered `set` or `dict.keys()` where order influences output files.
- Always sort collections before generating Markdown, JSON, Mermaid code, or SARIF findings.

### 3. Cross-Platform File Handling
- Always use `pathlib.Path` for filesystem operations.
- Internally normalize graph node and file paths to forward slashes (`/`) so diagrams and SARIF reports remain byte-for-byte identical across Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### 4. Modern Python Typing (3.10+)
- Use Python 3.10+ type union syntax: `str | None` instead of `Optional[str]`.
- Use built-in generic collections: `list[str]`, `dict[str, Any]`, `set[int]`.
- Import abstract collection types from `collections.abc` (e.g. `from collections.abc import Iterable, Sequence`), **not** from `typing`.
- Provide complete type hints for function signatures and data models.

### 5. Security Best Practices
- **No Code Execution**: Never call `eval()`, `exec()`, or dynamically `__import__()` untrusted user code.
- **Hashing**: When computing non-cryptographic hashes for IDs (e.g., `hashlib.sha1`), always pass `usedforsecurity=False` to comply with FIPS and Bandit security gates:
  ```python
  digest = hashlib.sha1(data.encode("utf-8"), usedforsecurity=False).hexdigest()
  ```
- **Subprocess Safety**: Pass commands as argument lists (`['mmdc', '-i', ...]`): never use `shell=True`. Set explicit execution timeouts.
- **Network Calls**: Always set explicit `timeout` on `urllib.request.urlopen`.

### 6. Dependency Pinning & Supply Chain
- Keep `dependencies = []` empty; the runtime remains standard-library only.
- Pin every development/build dependency with an exact `==` version in `pyproject.toml`. Never use ranges, `>=`, or `latest`.
- Pin GitHub Actions to full commit SHAs with a trailing version comment, and let Dependabot keep them current.
- Pin container and Compose images to an exact tag **and** `@sha256:` digest.
- Install Node tooling from the committed `docker/mermaid/package-lock.json` using `npm ci --omit=dev`; never use floating `npm install` in the image build.
- Treat any new dependency as a security review item: prefer first-party, actively maintained projects with reproducible lockfiles.

### 7. Container Security & Image Vulnerability Gating
- Automated container builds and releases to Docker Hub (`vserey/secdiagram`) require that all **CRITICAL** and **HIGH** severity image vulnerabilities are resolved prior to push.
- Container pushes are blocked by default if unresolved Critical or High vulnerabilities are detected.
- If an upstream base image vulnerability cannot be remediated immediately, a documented **Contextual Reachability and Exploitability Analysis** must prove that the finding is not reachable and not exploitable in `secdiagram`'s container environment (e.g. dead code, lack of network ingress, unprivileged UID 10001 user execution) before publication is permitted.

## Branching Model

| Branch | Purpose | Direct commits | Promotion |
|---|---|---|---|
| `main` | Stable, release-ready | Never | `develop` → `main` via release PR |
| `develop` | Integration | Never | Feature branches merged locally |
| `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `ci/...`, `docs/...` | Short-lived work | Yes | PR or local merge into `develop` |

- Branch from `develop` and keep it current with `origin/develop` before starting.
- `develop` must always contain the latest `main`.
- Merge features into `develop` locally only after the full verification suite passes; push `develop` after a clean merge.
- Promote `develop` to `main` only when a release is ready and all CI gates pass.
- Tag releases on `main` after the release merge is verified.
- After a release, sync `main` back into `develop`; the `develop-sync.yml` workflow does this automatically and fails loudly on conflicts.
- Never force-push `main`, `develop`, or any shared branch.

## 🤝 Pull Request Process

1. **Create or select a task**: Open a GitHub issue (or run `python scripts/taskctl.py new ...`) and move it to `In Progress` with `python scripts/taskctl.py start <issue>`.

2. **Fork and branch from `develop`**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout develop
   git merge --ff-only origin/develop
   git checkout -b feat/add-go-manifest-detection
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/sanitize-mermaid-subgraph-ids
   ```

3. **Develop and test**:
   - Write clean, commented code conforming to the guidelines above.
   - Add comprehensive unit tests under `tests/` covering new functionality and edge cases.
   - Ensure all tests pass: `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`.
   - Ensure linter passes: `ruff check .`.
   - Ensure type check passes: `mypy`.
   - Ensure security scan passes: `python -m bandit -r secdiagram_core -lll`.
   - Ensure task metadata validates: `python scripts/taskctl.py validate --offline`.
   - Ensure containerized build and smoke test pass:
     `docker build -t secdiagram:verify . && docker run --rm secdiagram:verify --help`
   - Ensure container image vulnerability scan passes:
     `trivy image --severity CRITICAL,HIGH secdiagram:verify`

4. **Verify Git Hygiene**:
   - Verify no secrets, `.env` files, temporary screenshots, or dump files are staged:
     ```bash
     git status
     git diff --cached
     ```
   - Confirm `.secdiagram/tasks/` is not staged; it is a local, read-only cache.

5. **Submit PR**: Open a Pull Request targeting the `develop` branch. Provide a clear description of:
   - What the PR accomplishes.
   - Why the change is needed.
   - A linked issue using `Closes #N`.
   - Test results and verification evidence.
   - Move the task to `In Review` with `python scripts/taskctl.py review <issue>` before requesting review.

6. **Release promotion**: Maintainers merge `develop` into `main` via a release Pull Request only when the release is ready, then tag the verified commit on `main`.
